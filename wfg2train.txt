VLADIMIR: You again! Come here till I embrace you.
ESTRAGON: Don't touch me!
VLADIMIR: Do you want me to go away? Gogo! Did they beat you? Gogo! Where did you spend the night?
ESTRAGON: Don't touch me! Don't question me! Don't speak to me! Stay with me!
VLADIMIR: Did I ever leave you?
ESTRAGON: You let me go.
VLADIMIR: Look at me. Will you look at me!
ESTRAGON: What a day!
VLADIMIR: Who beat you? Tell me.
ESTRAGON: Another day done with.
VLADIMIR: Not yet.
ESTRAGON: For me it's over and done with, no matter what happens. I heard you singing.
VLADIMIR: That's right, I remember.
ESTRAGON: That finished me. I said to myself, He's all alone, he thinks I'm gone for ever, and he sings.
VLADIMIR: One is not master of one's moods. All day I've felt in great form. I didn't get up in the night, not once!
ESTRAGON: You see, you piss better when I'm not there.
VLADIMIR: I missed you … and at the same time I was happy. Isn't that a strange thing?
ESTRAGON: Happy?
VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's not quite the right word.
ESTRAGON: And now?
VLADIMIR: Now? … There you are again … There we are again… There I am again.
ESTRAGON: You see, you feel worse when I'm with you. I feel better alone too.
VLADIMIR: Then why do you always come crawling back?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: No, but I do. It's because you don't know how to defend yourself. I wouldn't have let them beat you.
ESTRAGON: You couldn't have stopped them.
VLADIMIR: Why not?
ESTRAGON: There was ten of them.
VLADIMIR: No, I mean before they beat you. I would have stopped you from doing whatever it was you were doing.
ESTRAGON: I wasn't doing anything.
VLADIMIR: Then why did they beat you?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: Ah no, Gogo, the truth is there are things that escape you that don't escape me, you must feel it yourself.
ESTRAGON: I tell you I wasn't doing anything.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps you weren't. But it's the way of doing it that counts, the way of doing it, if you want to go on living.
ESTRAGON: I wasn't doing anything.
VLADIMIR: You must be happy too, deep down, if you only knew it.
ESTRAGON: Happy about what?
VLADIMIR: To be back with me again.
ESTRAGON: Would you say so?
VLADIMIR: Say you are, even if it's not true.
ESTRAGON: What am I to say?
VLADIMIR: Say, I am happy.
ESTRAGON: I am happy.
VLADIMIR: So am I.
ESTRAGON: So am I.
VLADIMIR: We are happy.
ESTRAGON: We are happy. What do we do now, now that we are happy?
VLADIMIR: Wait for Godot. Things have changed here since yesterday.
ESTRAGON: And if he doesn't come?
VLADIMIR: We'll see when the time comes. I was saying that things have changed here since yesterday.
ESTRAGON: Everything oozes.
VLADIMIR: Look at the tree.
ESTRAGON: It's never the same pus from one second to the next.
VLADIMIR: The tree, look at the tree.
ESTRAGON: Was it not there yesterday?
VLADIMIR: Yes of course it was there. Do you not remember? We nearly hanged ourselves from it. But you wouldn't. Do you not remember?
ESTRAGON: You dreamt it.
VLADIMIR: Is it possible you've forgotten already?
ESTRAGON: That's the way I am. Either I forget immediately or I never forget.
VLADIMIR: And Pozzo and Lucky, have you forgotten them too?
ESTRAGON: Pozzo and Lucky?
VLADIMIR: He's forgotten everything!
ESTRAGON: I remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me. Then he played the fool.
VLADIMIR: That was Lucky.
ESTRAGON: I remember that. But when was it?
VLADIMIR: And his keeper, do you not remember him?
ESTRAGON: He gave me a bone.
VLADIMIR: That was Pozzo.
ESTRAGON: And all that was yesterday, you say?
VLADIMIR: Yes of course it was yesterday.
ESTRAGON: And here where we are now?
VLADIMIR: Where else do you think? Do you not recognize the place?
ESTRAGON: Recognize! What is there to recognize? All my lousy life I've crawled about in the mud! And you talk to me about scenery! Look at this muckheap! I've never stirred from it!
VLADIMIR: Calm yourself, calm yourself.
ESTRAGON: You and your landscapes! Tell me about the worms!
VLADIMIR: All the same, you can't tell me that this bears any resemblance to … to the Macon country for example. You can't deny there's a big difference.
ESTRAGON: The Macon country! Who's talking to you about the Macon country?
VLADIMIR: But you were there yourself, in the Macon country.
ESTRAGON: No I was never in the Macon country! I've puked my puke of a life away here, I tell you! Here! In the Cackon country!
VLADIMIR: But we were there together, I could swear to it! Picking grapes for a man called … can't think of the name of the man, at a place called … can't think of the name of the place, do you not remember?
ESTRAGON: It's possible. I didn't notice anything.
VLADIMIR: But down there everything is red!
ESTRAGON: I didn't notice anything, I tell you!
VLADIMIR: You're a hard man to get on with, Gogo.
ESTRAGON: It'd be better if we parted.
VLADIMIR: You always say that and you always come crawling back.
ESTRAGON: The best thing would be to kill me, like the other.
VLADIMIR: What other? What other?
ESTRAGON: Like billions of others.
VLADIMIR: To every man his little cross. Till he dies. And is forgotten.
ESTRAGON: In the meantime let us try and converse calmly, since we are incapable of keeping silent.
VLADIMIR: You're right, we're inexhaustible.
ESTRAGON: It's so we won't think.
VLADIMIR: We have that excuse.
ESTRAGON: It's so we won't hear.
VLADIMIR: We have our reasons.
ESTRAGON: All the dead voices.
VLADIMIR: They make a noise like wings.
ESTRAGON: Like leaves.
VLADIMIR: Like sand.
ESTRAGON: Like leaves.
VLADIMIR: They all speak at once.
ESTRAGON: Each one to itself.
VLADIMIR: Rather they whisper.
ESTRAGON: They rustle.
VLADIMIR: They murmur.
ESTRAGON: They rustle.
VLADIMIR: What do they say?
ESTRAGON: They talk about their lives.
VLADIMIR: To have lived is not enough for them.
ESTRAGON: They have to talk about it.
VLADIMIR: To be dead is not enough for them.
ESTRAGON: It is not sufficient.
VLADIMIR: They make a noise like feathers.
ESTRAGON: Like leaves.
VLADIMIR: Likes ashes.
ESTRAGON: Like leaves.
VLADIMIR: Say something!
ESTRAGON: I'm trying.
VLADIMIR: Say anything at all!
ESTRAGON: What do we do now?
VLADIMIR: Wait for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah!
VLADIMIR: This is awful!
ESTRAGON: Sing something.
VLADIMIR: No no! We could start all over again perhaps.
ESTRAGON: That should be easy.
VLADIMIR: It's the start that's difficult.
ESTRAGON: You can start from anything.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but you have to decide.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Help me!
ESTRAGON: I'm trying.
VLADIMIR: When you seek you hear.
ESTRAGON: You do.
VLADIMIR: That prevents you from finding.
ESTRAGON: It does.
VLADIMIR: That prevents you from thinking.
ESTRAGON: You think all the same.
VLADIMIR: No no, it's impossible.
ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's contradict each another.
VLADIMIR: Impossible.
ESTRAGON: You think so?
VLADIMIR: We're in no danger of ever thinking any more.
ESTRAGON: Then what are we complaining about?
VLADIMIR: Thinking is not the worst.
ESTRAGON: Perhaps not. But at least there's that.
VLADIMIR: That what?
ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's ask each other questions.
VLADIMIR: What do you mean, at least there's that?
ESTRAGON: That much less misery.
VLADIMIR: True.
ESTRAGON: Well? If we gave thanks for our mercies?
VLADIMIR: What is terrible is to thought.
ESTRAGON: But did that ever happen to us?
VLADIMIR: Where are all these corpses from?
ESTRAGON: These skeletons.
VLADIMIR: Tell me that.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: We must have thought a little.
ESTRAGON: At the very beginning.
VLADIMIR: A charnel-house! A charnel-house!
ESTRAGON: You don't have to look.
VLADIMIR: You can't help looking.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Try as one may.
ESTRAGON: I beg your pardon?
VLADIMIR: Try as one may.
ESTRAGON: We should turn resolutely towards Nature.
VLADIMIR: We've tried that.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Oh it's not the worst, I know.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: To have thought.
ESTRAGON: Obviously.
VLADIMIR: But we could have done without it.
ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous?
VLADIMIR: I beg your pardon?
ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vouz.
VLADIMIR: Ah! que voulez-vous. Exactly.
ESTRAGON: That wasn't such a bad little canter.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but now we'll have to find something else.
ESTRAGON: Let me see.
VLADIMIR: Let me see. Ah!
ESTRAGON: Well?
VLADIMIR: What was I saying, we could go on from there.
ESTRAGON: What were you saying when?
VLADIMIR: At the very beginning.
ESTRAGON: The very beginning of WHAT?
VLADIMIR: This evening … I was saying … I was saying …
ESTRAGON: I'm not a historian.
VLADIMIR: Wait … we embraced … we were happy … happy … what do we do now that we're happy … go on waiting … waiting … let me think … it's coming … go on waiting … now that we're happy … let me see … ah! The tree!
ESTRAGON: The tree?
VLADIMIR: Do you not remember?
ESTRAGON: I'm tired.
VLADIMIR: Look at it.
ESTRAGON: I see nothing.
VLADIMIR: But yesterday evening it was all black and bare. And now it's covered with leaves.
ESTRAGON: Leaves?
VLADIMIR: In a single night.
ESTRAGON: It must be the Spring.
VLADIMIR: But in a single night!
ESTRAGON: I tell you we weren't here yesterday. Another of your nightmares.
VLADIMIR: And where were we yesterday evening according to you?
ESTRAGON: How would I know? In another compartment. There's no lack of void.
VLADIMIR: Good. We weren't here yesterday evening. Now what did we do yesterday evening?
ESTRAGON: Do?
VLADIMIR: Try and remember.
ESTRAGON: Do … I suppose we blathered.
VLADIMIR: About what?
ESTRAGON: Oh … this and that I suppose, nothing in particular. Yes, now I remember, yesterday evening we spent blathering about nothing in particular. That's been going on now for half a century.
VLADIMIR: You don't remember any fact, any circumstance?
ESTRAGON: Don't torment me, Didi.
VLADIMIR: The sun. The moon. Do you not remember?
ESTRAGON: They must have been there, as usual.
VLADIMIR: You didn't notice anything out of the ordinary?
ESTRAGON: Alas!
VLADIMIR: And Pozzo? And Lucky?
ESTRAGON: Pozzo?
VLADIMIR: The bones.
ESTRAGON: They were like fishbones.
VLADIMIR: It was Pozzo gave them to you.
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: And the kick.
ESTRAGON: That's right, someone gave me a kick.
VLADIMIR: It was Lucky gave it to you.
ESTRAGON: And all that was yesterday?
VLADIMIR: Show me your leg.
ESTRAGON: Which?
VLADIMIR: Both. Pull up your trousers. Pull up your trousers.
ESTRAGON: I can't.
VLADIMIR: The other. The other, pig! There's the wound! Beginning to fester!
ESTRAGON: And what about it?
VLADIMIR: That's where you were sitting yesterday evening.
ESTRAGON: If I could only sleep.
VLADIMIR: Yesterday you slept.
ESTRAGON: I'll try.
VLADIMIR: Wait.
ESTRAGON: Not so loud!
VLADIMIR: There … there … Didi is here … don't be afraid …
ESTRAGON: Ah!
VLADIMIR: There … there … it's all over.
ESTRAGON: I was falling—
VLADIMIR: It's all over, it's all over.
ESTRAGON: I was on top of a—
VLADIMIR: Don't tell me! Come, we'll walk it off.
ESTRAGON: That's enough. I'm tired.
VLADIMIR: You'd rather be stuck there doing nothing?
ESTRAGON: Yes.
VLADIMIR: Please yourself.
ESTRAGON: Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! Can you not stay still?
VLADIMIR: I'm cold.
ESTRAGON: We came too soon.
VLADIMIR: It's always at nightfall.
ESTRAGON: But night doesn't fall.
VLADIMIR: It'll fall all of a sudden, like yesterday.
ESTRAGON: Then it'll be night.
VLADIMIR: And we can go.
ESTRAGON: Then it'll be day again. What'll we do, what'll we do!
VLADIMIR: Will you stop whining! I've had about my bellyful of your lamentations!
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: Well!
ESTRAGON: Farewell.
VLADIMIR: Lucky's hat. I've been here an hour and never saw it. Fine!
ESTRAGON: You'll never see me again.
VLADIMIR: I knew it was the right place. Now our troubles are over. Must have been a very fine hat. Here.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: Hold that. How does it fit me?
ESTRAGON: How would I know?
VLADIMIR: No, but how do I look in it?
ESTRAGON: Hideous.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but not more so than usual?
ESTRAGON: Neither more nor less.
VLADIMIR: Then I can keep it. Mine irked me. How shall I say? It itched me.
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: Will you not play?
ESTRAGON: Play at what?
VLADIMIR: We could play at Pozzo and Lucky.
ESTRAGON: Never heard of it.
VLADIMIR: I'll do Lucky, you do Pozzo. Go on.
ESTRAGON: What am I to do?
VLADIMIR: Curse me!
ESTRAGON: Naughty!
VLADIMIR: Stronger!
ESTRAGON: Gonococcus! Spirochete!
VLADIMIR: Tell me to think.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: Say, Think, pig!
ESTRAGON: Think, pig!
VLADIMIR: I can't.
ESTRAGON: That's enough of that.
VLADIMIR: Tell me to dance.
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: Dance, hog! I can't! Gogo! There you are again at last!
ESTRAGON: I'm accursed!
VLADIMIR: Where were you? I thought you were gone for ever.
ESTRAGON: They're coming!
VLADIMIR: Who?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: How many?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: It's Godot! At last! Gogo! It's Godot! We're saved! Let's go and meet him! Gogo! Come back! There you are again again!
ESTRAGON: I'm in hell!
VLADIMIR: Where were you?
ESTRAGON: They're coming there too!
VLADIMIR: We're surrounded! Imbecile! There's no way out there. There! Not a soul in sight! Off you go! Quick! You won't? Well I can understand that. Wait till I see. Your only hope left is to disappear.
ESTRAGON: Where?
VLADIMIR: Behind the tree. Quick! Behind the tree. Decidedly this tree will not have been the slightest use to us.
ESTRAGON: I lost my head. Forgive me. It won't happen again. Tell me what to do.
VLADIMIR: There's nothing to do.
ESTRAGON: You go and stand there. There, don't move, and watch out. Back to back like in the good old days. Do you see anything coming?
VLADIMIR: What?
ESTRAGON: Do you see anything coming?
VLADIMIR: No.
ESTRAGON: Nor I.
VLADIMIR: You must have had a vision.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: You must have had a vision.
ESTRAGON: No need to shout!
VLADIMIR and ESTRAGON: Do you—
VLADIMIR: Oh pardon!
ESTRAGON: Carry on.
VLADIMIR: No no, after you.
ESTRAGON: No no, you first.
VLADIMIR: I interrupted you.
ESTRAGON: On the contrary.
VLADIMIR: Ceremonious ape!
ESTRAGON: Punctilious pig!
VLADIMIR: Finish your phrase, I tell you!
ESTRAGON: Finish your own!
VLADIMIR: Moron!
ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's abuse each other.
VLADIMIR: Moron!
ESTRAGON: Vermin!
VLADIMIR: Abortion!
ESTRAGON: Morpion!
VLADIMIR: Sewer-rat!
ESTRAGON: Curate!
VLADIMIR: Cretin!
ESTRAGON: Crritic!
VLADIMIR: Oh!
ESTRAGON: Now let's make it up.
VLADIMIR: Gogo!
ESTRAGON: Didi!
VLADIMIR: Your hand!
ESTRAGON: Take it!
VLADIMIR: Come to my arms!
ESTRAGON: Yours arms?
VLADIMIR: My breast!
ESTRAGON: Off we go!
VLADIMIR: How time flies when one has fun!
ESTRAGON: What do we do now?
VLADIMIR: While waiting.
ESTRAGON: While waiting.
VLADIMIR: We could do our exercises.
ESTRAGON: Our movements.
VLADIMIR: Our elevations.
ESTRAGON: Our relaxations.
VLADIMIR: Our elongations.
ESTRAGON: Our relaxations.
VLADIMIR: To warm us up.
ESTRAGON: To calm us down.
VLADIMIR: Off we go.
ESTRAGON: That's enough. I'm tired.
VLADIMIR: We're not in form. What about a little deep breathing?
ESTRAGON: I'm tired breathing.
VLADIMIR: You're right. Let's just do the tree, for the balance.
ESTRAGON: The tree?
VLADIMIR: Your turn.
ESTRAGON: Do you think God sees me?
VLADIMIR: You must close your eyes.
ESTRAGON: God have pity on me!
VLADIMIR: And me?
ESTRAGON: On me! On me! Pity! On me!
VLADIMIR: Gogo!
POZZO: What is it? Who is it?
ESTRAGON: Is it Godot?
VLADIMIR: At last! Reinforcements at last!
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: Is it Godot?
VLADIMIR: We were beginning to weaken. Now we're sure to see the evening out.
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: Do you hear him?
VLADIMIR: We are no longer alone, waiting for the night, waiting for Godot, waiting for … waiting. All evening we have struggled, unassisted. Now it's over. It's already tomorrow.
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: Time flows again already. The sun will set, the moon rise, and we away … from here.
POZZO: Pity!
VLADIMIR: Poor Pozzo!
ESTRAGON: I knew it was him.
VLADIMIR: Who?
ESTRAGON: Godot.
VLADIMIR: But it's not Godot.
ESTRAGON: It's not Godot?
VLADIMIR: It's not Godot.
ESTRAGON: Then who is it?
VLADIMIR: It's Pozzo.
POZZO: Here! Here! Help me up!
VLADIMIR: He can't get up.
ESTRAGON: Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah!
VLADIMIR: Perhaps he has another bone for you.
ESTRAGON: Bone?
VLADIMIR: Chicken. Do you not remember?
ESTRAGON: It was him?
VLADIMIR: Yes.
ESTRAGON: Ask him.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps we should help him first.
ESTRAGON: To do what?
VLADIMIR: To get up.
ESTRAGON: He can't get up?
VLADIMIR: He wants to get up.
ESTRAGON: Then let him get up.
VLADIMIR: He can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: I don't know.
ESTRAGON: We should ask him for the bone first. Then if he refuses we'll leave him there.
VLADIMIR: You mean we have him at our mercy?
ESTRAGON: Yes.
VLADIMIR: And that we should subordinate our good offices to certain conditions?
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: That seems intelligent all right. But there's one thing I'm afraid of.
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: That Lucky might get going all of a sudden. Then we'd be ballocksed.
ESTRAGON: Lucky?
VLADIMIR: The one that went for you yesterday.
ESTRAGON: I tell you there was ten of them.
VLADIMIR: No, before that, the one that kicked you.
ESTRAGON: Is he there?
VLADIMIR: As large as life. For the moment he is inert. But he might run amuck any minute.
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: And suppose we gave him a good beating, the two of us.
VLADIMIR: You mean if we fell on him in his sleep?
ESTRAGON: Yes.
VLADIMIR: That seems a good idea all right. But could we do it? Is he really asleep? No, the best would be to take advantage of Pozzo's calling for help—
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: To help him—
ESTRAGON: help ?
VLADIMIR: In anticipation of some tangible return.
ESTRAGON: And suppose he—
VLADIMIR: Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say? It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, is the question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come—
ESTRAGON: Ah!
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: Or for night to fall. We have kept our appointment and that's an end to that. We are not saints, but we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as much?
ESTRAGON: Billions.
VLADIMIR: You think so?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: You may be right.
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: All I know is that the hours are long, under these conditions, and constrain us to beguile them with proceedings which –how shall I say– which may at first sight seem reasonable, until they become a habit. You may say it is to prevent our reason from foundering. No doubt. But has it not long been straying in the night without end of the abyssal depths? That's what I sometimes wonder. You follow my reasoning?
ESTRAGON: We are all born mad. Some remain so.
POZZO: Help! I'll pay you!
ESTRAGON: How much?
POZZO: One hundred francs!
ESTRAGON: It's not enough.
VLADIMIR: I wouldn't go so far as that.
ESTRAGON: You think it's enough?
VLADIMIR: No, I mean so far as to assert that I was weak in the head when I came into the world. But that is not the question.
POZZO: Two hundred!
VLADIMIR: We wait. We are bored. No, don't protest, we are bored to death, there's no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let it go to waste. Come, let's get to work! In an instant all will vanish and we'll be alone once more, in the midst of nothingness!
POZZO: Two hundred!
VLADIMIR: We're coming!
ESTRAGON: What's the matter with you all?
VLADIMIR: Help!
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: Don't leave me! They'll kill me!
POZZO: Where am I?
VLADIMIR: Gogo!
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: Help!
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: Help me up first, then we'll go together.
ESTRAGON: You promise?
VLADIMIR: I swear it!
ESTRAGON: And we'll never come back?
VLADIMIR: Never!
ESTRAGON: We'll go to the Pyrenees.
VLADIMIR: Wherever you like.
ESTRAGON: I've always wanted to wander in the Pyrenees.
VLADIMIR: You'll wander in them.
ESTRAGON: Who farted?
VLADIMIR: Pozzo.
POZZO: Here! Here! Pity!
ESTRAGON: It's revolting!
VLADIMIR: Quick! Give me your hand!
ESTRAGON: I'm going. I'm going.
VLADIMIR: Well I suppose in the end I'll get up by myself. In the fullness of time.
ESTRAGON: What's the matter with you?
VLADIMIR: Go to hell.
ESTRAGON: Are you staying there?
VLADIMIR: For the time being.
ESTRAGON: Come on, get up, you'll catch a chill.
VLADIMIR: Don't worry about me.
ESTRAGON: Come on, Didi, don't be pig-headed!
VLADIMIR: Pull!
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: We've arrived.
POZZO: Who are you?
VLADIMIR: We are men.
ESTRAGON: Sweet mother earth!
VLADIMIR: Can you get up?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: Try.
ESTRAGON: Not now, not now.
POZZO: What happened?
VLADIMIR: Will you stop it, you! Pest! He can think of nothing but himself!
ESTRAGON: What about a little snooze?
VLADIMIR: Did you hear him? He wants to know what happened!
ESTRAGON: Don't mind him. Sleep.
POZZO: Pity! Pity!
ESTRAGON: What is it?
VLADIMIR: Were you asleep?
ESTRAGON: I must have been.
VLADIMIR: It's this bastard Pozzo at it again.
ESTRAGON: Make him stop it. Kick him in the crotch.
VLADIMIR: Will you stop it! Crablouse! He's off! He's down!
ESTRAGON: What do we do now?
VLADIMIR: Perhaps I could crawl to him.
ESTRAGON: Don't leave me!
VLADIMIR: Or I could call to him.
ESTRAGON: Yes, call to him.
VLADIMIR: Pozzo! Pozzo! No reply.
ESTRAGON: Together.
VLADIMIR and ESTRAGON: Pozzo! Pozzo!
VLADIMIR: He moved.
ESTRAGON: Are you sure his name is Pozzo?
VLADIMIR: Mr. Pozzo! Come back! We won't hurt you!
ESTRAGON: We might try him with other names.
VLADIMIR: I'm afraid he's dying.
ESTRAGON: It'd be amusing.
VLADIMIR: What'd be amusing?
ESTRAGON: To try him with other names, one after the other. It'd pass the time. And we'd be bound to hit on the right one sooner or later.
VLADIMIR: I tell you his name is Pozzo.
ESTRAGON: We'll soon see. Abel! Abel!
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: Got it in one!
VLADIMIR: I begin to weary of this motif.
ESTRAGON: Perhaps the other is called Cain. Cain! Cain!
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: He's all humanity. Look at the little cloud.
VLADIMIR: Where?
ESTRAGON: There. In the zenith.
VLADIMIR: Well? What is there so wonderful about it?
ESTRAGON: Let's pass on now to something else, do you mind?
VLADIMIR: I was just going to suggest it.
ESTRAGON: But to what?
VLADIMIR: Ah!
ESTRAGON: Suppose we got up to begin with?
VLADIMIR: No harm trying.
ESTRAGON: Child's play.
VLADIMIR: Simple question of will-power.
ESTRAGON: And now?
POZZO: Help!
ESTRAGON: Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! What'll we do, what'll we do!
POZZO: Help!
VLADIMIR: What about helping him?
ESTRAGON: What does he want?
VLADIMIR: He wants to get up.
ESTRAGON: Then why doesn't he?
VLADIMIR: He wants us to help him get up.
ESTRAGON: Then why don't we? What are we waiting for?
VLADIMIR: We must hold him. Feeling better?
POZZO: Who are you?
VLADIMIR: Do you not recognize us?
POZZO: I am blind.
ESTRAGON: Perhaps he can see into the future.
VLADIMIR: Since when?
POZZO: I used to have wonderful sight— but are you friends?
ESTRAGON: He wants to know if we are friends!
VLADIMIR: No, he means friends of his.
ESTRAGON: Well?
VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, by helping him.
ESTRAGON: Exactly. Would we have helped him if we weren't his friends?
VLADIMIR: Possibly.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Don't let's quibble about that now.
POZZO: You are not highwaymen?
ESTRAGON: Highwaymen! Do we look like highwaymen?
VLADIMIR: Damn it, can't you see the man is blind!
ESTRAGON: Damn it, so he is. So he says.
POZZO: Don't leave me!
VLADIMIR: No question of it.
ESTRAGON: For the moment.
POZZO: What time is it?
VLADIMIR: Seven o'clock … eight o'clock …
ESTRAGON: That depends what time of year it is.
POZZO: Is it evening?
ESTRAGON: It's rising.
VLADIMIR: Impossible.
ESTRAGON: Perhaps it's the dawn.
VLADIMIR: Don't be a fool. It's the west over there.
ESTRAGON: How do you know?
POZZO: Is it evening?
VLADIMIR: Anyway, it hasn't moved.
ESTRAGON: I tell you it's rising.
POZZO: Why don't you answer me?
ESTRAGON: Give us a chance.
VLADIMIR: It's evening, Sir, it's evening, night is drawing nigh. My friend here would have me doubt it and I must confess he shook me for a moment. But it is not for nothing I have lived through this long day and I can assure you it is very near the end of its repertory. How do you feel now?
ESTRAGON: How much longer are we to cart him around? We are not caryatids!
VLADIMIR: You were saying your sight used to be good, if I heard you right.
POZZO: Wonderful! Wonderful, wonderful sight!
ESTRAGON: Expand! Expand!
VLADIMIR: Let him alone. Can't you see he's thinking of the days when he was happy. — that must be unpleasant.
ESTRAGON: We wouldn't know.
VLADIMIR: And it came on you all of a sudden?
POZZO: Quite wonderful!
VLADIMIR: I'm asking you if it came on you all of a sudden.
POZZO: I woke up one fine day as blind as Fortune. Sometimes I wonder if I'm not still asleep.
VLADIMIR: And when was that?
POZZO: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: But no later than yesterday—
POZZO: Don't question me! The blind have no notion of time. The things of time are hidden from them too.
VLADIMIR: Well just fancy that! I could have sworn it was just the opposite.
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
POZZO: Where are we?
VLADIMIR: I couldn't tell you.
POZZO: It isn't by any chance the place known as the Board?
VLADIMIR: Never heard of it.
POZZO: What is it like?
VLADIMIR: It's indescribable. It's like nothing. There's nothing. There's a tree.
POZZO: Then it's not the Board.
ESTRAGON: Some diversion!
POZZO: Where is my menial?
VLADIMIR: He's about somewhere.
POZZO: Why doesn't he answer when I call?
VLADIMIR: I don't know. He seems to be sleeping. Perhaps he's dead.
POZZO: What happened, exactly?
ESTRAGON: Exactly!
VLADIMIR: The two of you slipped. And fell.
POZZO: Go and see is he hurt.
VLADIMIR: We can't leave you.
POZZO: You needn't both go.
VLADIMIR: You go.
ESTRAGON: After what he did to me? Never!
POZZO: Yes yes, let your friend go, he stinks so. What is he waiting for?
VLADIMIR: What are you waiting for?
ESTRAGON: I'm waiting for Godot.
VLADIMIR: What exactly should he do?
POZZO: Well to begin with he should pull on the rope, as hard as he likes so long as he doesn't strangle him. He usually responds to that. If not he should give him a taste of his boot, in the face and the privates as far as possible.
VLADIMIR: You see, you've nothing to be afraid of. It's even an opportunity to revenge yourself.
ESTRAGON: And if he defends himself?
POZZO: No no, he never defends himself.
VLADIMIR: I'll come flying to the rescue.
ESTRAGON: Don't take your eyes off me.
VLADIMIR: Make sure he's alive before you start. No point in exerting yourself if he's dead.
ESTRAGON: He's breathing.
VLADIMIR: Then let him have it.
ESTRAGON: Oh the brute!
POZZO: What's gone wrong now?
VLADIMIR: My friend has hurt himself.
POZZO: And Lucky?
VLADIMIR: So it is he?
POZZO: What?
VLADIMIR: It is Lucky?
POZZO: I don't understand.
VLADIMIR: And you are Pozzo?
POZZO: Certainly I am Pozzo.
VLADIMIR: The same as yesterday?
POZZO: Yesterday?
VLADIMIR: We met yesterday. Do you not remember?
POZZO: I don't remember having met anyone yesterday. But tomorrow I won't remember having met anyone today. So don't count on me to enlighten you.
VLADIMIR: But—
POZZO: Enough! Up pig!
VLADIMIR: You were bringing him to the fair to sell him. You spoke to us. He danced. He thought. You had your sight.
POZZO: As you please. Let me go! Up!
VLADIMIR: Where do you go from here?
POZZO: On. Whip! Rope!
VLADIMIR: What is there in the bag?
POZZO: Sand. On!
VLADIMIR: Don't go yet.
POZZO: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: What do you do when you fall far from help?
POZZO: We wait till we can get up. Then we go on. On!
VLADIMIR: Before you go tell him to sing.
POZZO: Who?
VLADIMIR: Lucky.
POZZO: To sing?
VLADIMIR: Yes. Or to think. Or to recite.
POZZO: But he is dumb.
VLADIMIR: Dumb!
POZZO: Dumb. He can't even groan.
VLADIMIR: Dumb! Since when?
POZZO: Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed time! It's abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we'll go deaf, one day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for you? They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more. On!
ESTRAGON: Why will you never let me sleep?
VLADIMIR: I felt lonely.
ESTRAGON: I was dreaming I was happy.
VLADIMIR: That passed the time.
ESTRAGON: I was dreaming that—
VLADIMIR: Don't tell me! I wonder is he really blind.
ESTRAGON: Blind? Who?
VLADIMIR: Pozzo.
ESTRAGON: Blind?
VLADIMIR: He told us he was blind.
ESTRAGON: Well what about it?
VLADIMIR: It seemed to me he saw us.
ESTRAGON: You dreamt it. Let's go. We can't. Ah! Are you sure it wasn't him?
VLADIMIR: Who?
ESTRAGON: Godot.
VLADIMIR: But who?
ESTRAGON: Pozzo.
VLADIMIR: Not at all! Not at all! Not at all!
ESTRAGON: I suppose I might as well get up. Ow! Didi!
VLADIMIR: I don't know what to think any more.
ESTRAGON: My feet! Help me!
VLADIMIR: Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this place, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his carrier, and that he spoke to us? Probably. But in all that what truth will there be? He'll know nothing. He'll tell me about the blows he received and I'll give him a carrot. Astride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on the forceps. We have time to grow old. The air is fullof our cries. But habit is a great deadener. At me too someone is looking, of me too someone is saying, He is sleeping, he knows nothing, let him sleep on. I can't go on! What have I said?
BOY: Mister … Mister Albert …
VLADIMIR: Off we go again. Do you not recognize me?
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: It wasn't you came yesterday.
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: This is your first time.
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: You have a message from Mr. Godot.
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: He won't come this evening.
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: But he'll come tomorrow.
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Without fail.
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Did you meet anyone?
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: Two other … men?
BOY: I didn't see anyone, Sir.
VLADIMIR: What does he do, Mr. Godot? Do you hear me?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Well?
BOY: He does nothing, Sir.
VLADIMIR: How is your brother?
BOY: He's sick, Sir.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps it was he came yesterday.
BOY: I don't know, Sir.
VLADIMIR: Has he a beard, Mr. Godot?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Fair or … or black?
BOY: I think it's white, Sir.
VLADIMIR: Christ have mercy on us!
BOY: What am I to tell Mr. Godot, Sir?
VLADIMIR: Tell him … tell him you saw me and that … that you saw me. You're sure you saw me, you won't come and tell me tomorrow that you never saw me!
ESTRAGON: What's wrong with you?
VLADIMIR: Nothing.
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: So am I.
ESTRAGON: Was I long asleep?
VLADIMIR: I don't know.
ESTRAGON: Where shall we go?
VLADIMIR: Not far.
ESTRAGON: Oh yes, let's go far away from here.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We have to come back tomorrow.
ESTRAGON: What for?
VLADIMIR: To wait for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! He didn't come?
VLADIMIR: No.
ESTRAGON: And now it's too late.
VLADIMIR: Yes, now it's night.
ESTRAGON: And if we dropped him? If we dropped him?
VLADIMIR: He'd punish us. Everything's dead but the tree.
ESTRAGON: What is it?
VLADIMIR: It's the tree.
ESTRAGON: Yes, but what kind?
VLADIMIR: I don't know. A willow.
ESTRAGON: Why don't we hang ourselves?
VLADIMIR: With what?
ESTRAGON: You haven't got a bit of rope?
VLADIMIR: No.
ESTRAGON: Then we can't.
VLADIMIR: Let's go.
ESTRAGON: Wait, there's my belt.
VLADIMIR: It's too short.
ESTRAGON: You could hang onto my legs.
VLADIMIR: And who'd hang onto mine?
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Show me all the same. It might do in a pinch. But is it strong enough?
ESTRAGON: We'll soon see. Here.
VLADIMIR: Not worth a curse.
ESTRAGON: You say we have to come back tomorrow?
VLADIMIR: Yes.
ESTRAGON: Then we can bring a good bit of rope.
VLADIMIR: Yes.
ESTRAGON: Didi?
VLADIMIR: Yes.
ESTRAGON: I can't go on like this.
VLADIMIR: That's what you think.
ESTRAGON: If we parted? That might be better for us.
VLADIMIR: We'll hang ourselves tomorrow. Unless Godot comes.
ESTRAGON: And if he comes?
VLADIMIR: We'll be saved.
ESTRAGON: Well? Shall we go?
VLADIMIR: Pull on your trousers.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: Pull on your trousers.
ESTRAGON: You want me to pull off my trousers?
VLADIMIR: Pull ON your trousers.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Well? Shall we go?
ESTRAGON: Yes, let's go.
