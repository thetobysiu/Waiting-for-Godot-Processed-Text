ESTRAGON: Nothing to be done.
VLADIMIR: I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my life I've tried to put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle. So there you are again.
ESTRAGON: Am I?
VLADIMIR: I'm glad to see you back. I thought you were gone forever.
ESTRAGON: Me too.
VLADIMIR: Together again at last! We'll have to celebrate this. But how? Get up till I embrace you.
ESTRAGON: Not now, not now.
VLADIMIR: May one inquire where His Highness spent the night?
ESTRAGON: In a ditch.
VLADIMIR: A ditch! Where?
ESTRAGON: Over there.
VLADIMIR: And they didn't beat you?
ESTRAGON: Beat me? Certainly they beat me.
VLADIMIR: The same lot as usual?
ESTRAGON: The same? I don't know.
VLADIMIR: When I think of it … all these years … but for me … where would you be … You'd be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute, no doubt about it.
ESTRAGON: And what of it?
VLADIMIR: It's too much for one man. On the other hand what's the good of losing heart now, that's what I say. We should have thought of it a million years ago, in the nineties.
ESTRAGON: Ah stop blathering and help me off with this bloody thing.
VLADIMIR: Hand in hand from the top of the Eiffel Tower, among the first. We were respectable in those days. Now it's too late. They wouldn't even let us up. What are you doing?
ESTRAGON: Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to you?
VLADIMIR: Boots must be taken off every day, I'm tired telling you that. Why don't you listen to me?
ESTRAGON: Help me!
VLADIMIR: It hurts?
ESTRAGON: Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts!
VLADIMIR: No one ever suffers but you. I don't count. I'd like to hear what you'd say if you had what I have.
ESTRAGON: It hurts?
VLADIMIR: Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts!
ESTRAGON: You might button it all the same.
VLADIMIR: True. Never neglect the little things of life.
ESTRAGON: What do you expect, you always wait till the last moment.
VLADIMIR: The last moment … Hope deferred maketh the something sick, who said that?
ESTRAGON: Why don't you help me?
VLADIMIR: Sometimes I feel it coming all the same. Then I go all queer. How shall I say? Relieved and at the same time … appalled. AP-PALLED. Funny. Nothing to be done. Well?
ESTRAGON: Nothing.
VLADIMIR: Show me.
ESTRAGON: There's nothing to show.
VLADIMIR: Try and put it on again.
ESTRAGON: I'll air it for a bit.
VLADIMIR: There's man all over for you, blaming on his boots the faults of his feet. This is getting alarming. One of the thieves was saved. It's a reasonable percentage. Gogo.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: Suppose we repented.
ESTRAGON: Repented what?
VLADIMIR: Oh … We wouldn't have to go into the details.
ESTRAGON: Our being born?
VLADIMIR: One daren't even laugh any more.
ESTRAGON: Dreadful privation.
VLADIMIR: Merely smile. It's not the same thing. Nothing to be done. Gogo.
ESTRAGON: What is it?
VLADIMIR: Did you ever read the Bible?
ESTRAGON: The Bible … I must have taken a look at it.
VLADIMIR: Do you remember the Gospels?
ESTRAGON: I remember the maps of the Holy Land. Coloured they were. Very pretty. The Dead Sea was pale blue. The very look of it made me thirsty. That's where we'll go, I used to say, that's where we'll go for our honeymoon. We'll swim. We'll be happy.
VLADIMIR: You should have been a poet.
ESTRAGON: I was. Isn't that obvious?
VLADIMIR: Where was I … How's your foot?
ESTRAGON: Swelling visibly.
VLADIMIR: Ah yes, the two thieves. Do you remember the story?
ESTRAGON: No.
VLADIMIR: Shall I tell it to you?
ESTRAGON: No.
VLADIMIR: It'll pass the time. Two thieves, crucified at the same time as our Saviour. One—
ESTRAGON: Our what?
VLADIMIR: Our Saviour. Two thieves. One is supposed to have been saved and the other … damned.
ESTRAGON: Saved from what?
VLADIMIR: Hell.
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
VLADIMIR: And yet … how is it –this is not boring you I hope– how is it that of the four Evangelists only one speaks of a thief being saved. The four of them were there –or thereabouts– and only one speaks of a thief being saved. Come on, Gogo, return the ball, can't you, once in a way?
ESTRAGON: I find this really most extraordinarily interesting.
VLADIMIR: One out of four. Of the other three, two don't mention any thieves at all and the third says that both of them abused him.
ESTRAGON: Who?
VLADIMIR: What?
ESTRAGON: What's all this about? Abused who?
VLADIMIR: The Saviour.
ESTRAGON: Why?
VLADIMIR: Because he wouldn't save them.
ESTRAGON: From hell?
VLADIMIR: Imbecile! From death.
ESTRAGON: I thought you said hell.
VLADIMIR: From death, from death.
ESTRAGON: Well what of it?
VLADIMIR: Then the two of them must have been damned.
ESTRAGON: And why not?
VLADIMIR: But one of the four says that one of the two was saved.
ESTRAGON: Well? They don't agree and that's all there is to it.
VLADIMIR: But all four were there. And only one speaks of a thief being saved. Why believe him rather than the others?
ESTRAGON: Who believes him?
VLADIMIR: Everybody. It's the only version they know.
ESTRAGON: People are bloody ignorant apes.
VLADIMIR: Pah!
ESTRAGON: Charming spot. Inspiring prospects. Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! You're sure it was here?
VLADIMIR: What?
ESTRAGON: That we were to wait.
VLADIMIR: He said by the tree. Do you see any others?
ESTRAGON: What is it?
VLADIMIR: I don't know. A willow.
ESTRAGON: Where are the leaves?
VLADIMIR: It must be dead.
ESTRAGON: No more weeping.
VLADIMIR: Or perhaps it's not the season.
ESTRAGON: Looks to me more like a bush.
VLADIMIR: A shrub.
ESTRAGON: A bush.
VLADIMIR: A—. What are you insinuating? That we've come to the wrong place?
ESTRAGON: He should be here.
VLADIMIR: He didn't say for sure he'd come.
ESTRAGON: And if he doesn't come?
VLADIMIR: We'll come back tomorrow.
ESTRAGON: And then the day after tomorrow.
VLADIMIR: Possibly.
ESTRAGON: And so on.
VLADIMIR: The point is—
ESTRAGON: Until he comes.
VLADIMIR: You're merciless.
ESTRAGON: We came here yesterday.
VLADIMIR: Ah no, there you're mistaken.
ESTRAGON: What did we do yesterday?
VLADIMIR: What did we do yesterday?
ESTRAGON: Yes.
VLADIMIR: Why … Nothing is certain when you're about.
ESTRAGON: In my opinion we were here.
VLADIMIR: You recognize the place?
ESTRAGON: I didn't say that.
VLADIMIR: Well?
ESTRAGON: That makes no difference.
VLADIMIR: All the same … that tree … that bog …
ESTRAGON: You're sure it was this evening?
VLADIMIR: What?
ESTRAGON: That we were to wait.
VLADIMIR: He said Saturday. I think.
ESTRAGON: You think.
VLADIMIR: I must have made a note of it.
ESTRAGON: But what Saturday? And is it Saturday? Is it not rather Sunday? Or Monday? Or Friday?
VLADIMIR: It's not possible!
ESTRAGON: Or Thursday?
VLADIMIR: What'll we do?
ESTRAGON: If he came yesterday and we weren't here you may be sure he won't come again today.
VLADIMIR: But you say we were here yesterday.
ESTRAGON: I may be mistaken. Let's stop talking for a minute, do you mind?
VLADIMIR: All right. Gogo! … Gogo! … GOGO!
ESTRAGON: I was asleep! Why will you never let me sleep?
VLADIMIR: I felt lonely.
ESTRAGON: I had a dream.
VLADIMIR: Don't tell me!
ESTRAGON: I dreamt that—
VLADIMIR: DON'T TELL ME!
ESTRAGON: This one is enough for you? It's not nice of you, Didi. Who am I to tell my private nightmares to if I can't tell them to you?
VLADIMIR: Let them remain private. You know I can't bear that.
ESTRAGON: There are times when I wonder if it wouldn't be better for us to part.
VLADIMIR: You wouldn't go far.
ESTRAGON: That would be too bad, really too bad. Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad? When you think of the beauty of the way. And the goodness of the wayfarers. Wouldn't it, Didi?
VLADIMIR: Calm yourself.
ESTRAGON: Calm … calm … The English say cawm. You know the story of the Englishman in the brothel?
VLADIMIR: Yes.
ESTRAGON: Tell it to me.
VLADIMIR: Ah stop it!
ESTRAGON: An Englishman having drunk a little more than usual proceeds to a brothel. The bawd asks him if he wants a fair one, a dark one or a red-haired one. Go on.
VLADIMIR: STOP IT!
ESTRAGON: You wanted to speak to me? You had something to say to me? Didi …
VLADIMIR: I've nothing to say to you.
ESTRAGON: You're angry? Forgive me. Come, Didi. Give me your hand. Embrace me! Don't be stubborn! You stink of garlic!
VLADIMIR: It's for the kidneys. What do we do now?
ESTRAGON: Wait.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but while waiting.
ESTRAGON: What about hanging ourselves?
VLADIMIR: Hmm. It'd give us an erection.
ESTRAGON: An erection!
VLADIMIR: With all that follows. Where it falls mandrakes grow. That's why they shriek when you pull them up. Did you not know that?
ESTRAGON: Let's hang ourselves immediately!
VLADIMIR: From a bough? I wouldn't trust it.
ESTRAGON: We can always try.
VLADIMIR: Go ahead.
ESTRAGON: After you.
VLADIMIR: No no, you first.
ESTRAGON: Why me?
VLADIMIR: You're lighter than I am.
ESTRAGON: Just so!
VLADIMIR: I don't understand.
ESTRAGON: Use your intelligence, can't you?
VLADIMIR: I remain in the dark.
ESTRAGON: This is how it is. The bough … the bough … Use your head, can't you?
VLADIMIR: You're my only hope.
ESTRAGON: Gogo light—bough not break—Gogo dead. Didi heavy—bough break—Didi alone. Whereas—
VLADIMIR: I hadn't thought of that.
ESTRAGON: If it hangs you it'll hang anything.
VLADIMIR: But am I heavier than you?
ESTRAGON: So you tell me. I don't know. There's an even chance. Or nearly.
POZZO: On! Back!
VLADIMIR: Let me go!
ESTRAGON: Stay where you are!
POZZO: Be careful! He's wicked. With strangers.
ESTRAGON: Is that him?
VLADIMIR: Who?
ESTRAGON: Er …
VLADIMIR: Godot?
ESTRAGON: Yes.
POZZO: I present myself:  Pozzo.
VLADIMIR: Not at all!
ESTRAGON: He said Godot.
VLADIMIR: Not at all!
ESTRAGON: You're not Mr. Godot, Sir?
POZZO: I am Pozzo! Pozzo! Does that name mean nothing to you? I say does that name mean nothing to you?
ESTRAGON: Bozzo … Bozzo …
VLADIMIR: Pozzo … Pozzo …
POZZO: PPPOZZZO!
ESTRAGON: Ah! Pozzo … let me see … Pozzo …
VLADIMIR: Is it Pozzo or Bozzo?
ESTRAGON: Pozzo … no … I'm afraid I … no … I don't seem to …
VLADIMIR: I once knew a family called Gozzo. The mother had the clap.
ESTRAGON: We're not from these parts, Sir.
POZZO: You are human beings none the less. As far as one can see. Of the same species as myself. Of the same species as Pozzo! Made in God's image!
VLADIMIR: Well you see—
POZZO: Who is Godot?
ESTRAGON: Godot?
POZZO: You took me for Godot.
VLADIMIR: Oh no, Sir, not for an instant, Sir.
POZZO: Who is he?
VLADIMIR: Oh he's a … he's a kind of acquaintance.
ESTRAGON: Nothing of the kind, we hardly know him.
VLADIMIR: True … we don't know him very well … but all the same …
ESTRAGON: Personally, I wouldn't even know him if I saw him.
POZZO: You took me for him.
ESTRAGON: That's to say … you understand … the dusk … the strain … waiting … I confess … I imagined … for a second …
POZZO: Waiting? So you were waiting for him?
VLADIMIR: Well you see—
POZZO: Here? On my land?
VLADIMIR: We didn't intend any harm.
ESTRAGON: We meant well.
POZZO: The road is free to all.
VLADIMIR: That's how we looked at it.
POZZO: It's a disgrace. But there you are.
ESTRAGON: Nothing we can do about it.
POZZO: Let's say no more about it. Up pig! Every time he drops he falls asleep. Up hog! Back! Stop! Turn! Gentlemen, I am happy to have met you. Yes yes, sincerely happy. Closer! Stop! Yes, the road seems long when one journeys all alone for … yes … yes, six hours, that's right, six hours on end, and never a soul in sight. Coat! Hold that! Coat! Touch of autumn in the air this evening. Whip! Yes, gentlemen, I cannot go forlong without the society of my likes even when the likeness is an imperfect one. Stool! Closer! Back! Further! Stop! That is why, with your permission, I propose to dally with you a moment, before I venture any further. Basket! The fresh air stimulates the jaded appetite. Basket! Further! He stinks. Happy days!
ESTRAGON: What ails him?
VLADIMIR: He looks tired.
ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags?
VLADIMIR: How do I know? Careful!
ESTRAGON: Say something to him.
VLADIMIR: Look!
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: His neck!
ESTRAGON: I see nothing.
VLADIMIR: Here.
ESTRAGON: Oh I say!
VLADIMIR: A running sore!
ESTRAGON: It's the rope.
VLADIMIR: It's the rubbing.
ESTRAGON: It's inevitable.
VLADIMIR: It's the knot.
ESTRAGON: It's the chafing.
VLADIMIR: He's not bad looking.
ESTRAGON: Would you say so?
VLADIMIR: A trifle effeminate.
ESTRAGON: Look at the slobber.
VLADIMIR: It's inevitable.
ESTRAGON: Look at the slaver.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps he's a halfwit.
ESTRAGON: A cretin.
VLADIMIR: Looks like a goiter.
ESTRAGON: It's not certain.
VLADIMIR: He's panting.
ESTRAGON: It's inevitable.
VLADIMIR: And his eyes!
ESTRAGON: What about them?
VLADIMIR: Goggling out of his head.
ESTRAGON: Looks like his last gasp to me.
VLADIMIR: It's not certain. Ask him a question.
ESTRAGON: Would that be a good thing?
VLADIMIR: What do we risk?
ESTRAGON: Mister …
VLADIMIR: Louder.
ESTRAGON: Mister …
POZZO: Leave him in peace! Can't you see he wants to rest? Basket! Basket! What can you expect, it's not his job. Ah! That's better.
ESTRAGON: Please Sir …
POZZO: What is it, my good man?
ESTRAGON: Er … you've finished with the … er … you don't need the … er … bones, Sir?
VLADIMIR: You couldn't have waited?
POZZO: No no, he does well to ask. Do I need the bones? No, personally I do not need them any more. But … but in theory the bones go to the carrier. He is therefore the one to ask. Go on, go on, don't be afraid, ask him, he'll tell you.
ESTRAGON: Mister … excuse me, Mister …
POZZO: You're being spoken to, pig! Reply! Try him again.
ESTRAGON: Excuse me, Mister, the bones, you won't be wanting the bones?
POZZO: Mister! Reply! Do you want them or don't you? They're yours. I don't like it. I've never known him to refuse a bone before. Nice business it'd be if he fell sick on me!
VLADIMIR: It's a scandal!
POZZO: Are you alluding to anything in particular?
VLADIMIR: To treat a man … like that … I think that … no … a human being … no … it's a scandal!
ESTRAGON: A disgrace!
POZZO: You are severe. What age are you, if it's not a rude question? Sixty? Seventy? What age would you say he was?
ESTRAGON: Eleven.
POZZO: I am impertinent. I must be getting on. Thank you for your society. Unless I smoke another pipe before I go. What do you say? Oh I'm only a small smoker, a very small smoker, I'm not in the habit of smoking two pipes one on top of the other, it makes my heart go pit-a-pat. It's the nicotine, one absorbs it in spite of one's precautions. You know how it is. But perhaps you don't smoke? Yes? No? It's of no importance. But how am I to sit down now, without affectation, now that I have risen? Without appearing to –how shall I say– without appearing to falter. I beg your pardon? Perhaps you didn't speak? It's of no importance. Let me see …
ESTRAGON: Ah! That's better.
VLADIMIR: Let's go.
ESTRAGON: So soon?
POZZO: One moment! Stool! More! There! Done it!
VLADIMIR: Let's go!
POZZO: I hope I'm not driving you away. Wait a little longer, you'll never regret it.
ESTRAGON: We're in no hurry.
POZZO: The second is never so sweet … as the first I mean. But it's sweet just the same.
VLADIMIR: I'm going.
POZZO: He can no longer endure my presence. I am perhaps not particularly human, but who cares? Think twice before you do anything rash. Suppose you go now while it is still day, for there is no denying it is still day. Good. What happens in that case– –I'm out– –in that case– –in that case– –what happens in that case to your appointment with this … Godet … Godot … Godin … anyhow you see who I mean, who has your future in his hands … at least your immediate future?
VLADIMIR: Who told you?
POZZO: He speaks to me again! If this goes on much longer we'll soon be old friends.
ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags?
POZZO: I too would be happy to meet him. The more people I meet the happier I become. From the meanest creature one departs wiser, richer, more conscious of one's blessings. Even you … even you, who knows, will have added to my store.
ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags?
POZZO: But that would surprise me.
VLADIMIR: You're being asked a question.
POZZO: A question! Who? What? A moment ago you were calling me Sir, in fear and trembling. Now you're asking me questions. No good will come of this!
VLADIMIR: I think he's listening.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: You can ask him now. He's on the alert.
ESTRAGON: Ask him what?
VLADIMIR: Why he doesn't put down his bags.
ESTRAGON: I wonder.
VLADIMIR: Ask him, can't you?
POZZO: You want to know why he doesn't put down his bags, as you call them.
VLADIMIR: That's it.
POZZO: You are sure you agree with that?
ESTRAGON: He's puffing like a grampus.
POZZO: The answer is this. But stay still, I beg of you, you're making me nervous!
VLADIMIR: Here.
ESTRAGON: What is it?
VLADIMIR: He's about to speak.
POZZO: Good. Is everybody ready? Is everybody looking at me? Will you look at me, pig! Good. I am ready. Is everybody listening? Is everybody ready? Hog! I don't like talking in a vacuum. Good. Let me see.
ESTRAGON: I'm going.
POZZO: What was it exactly you wanted to know?
VLADIMIR: Why he—
POZZO: Don't interrupt me! If we all speak at once we'll never get anywhere. What was I saying? What was I saying?
ESTRAGON: Bags. Why? Always hold. Never put down. Why?
POZZO: Ah! Why couldn't you say so before? Why he doesn't make himself comfortable? Let's try and get this clear. Has he not the right to? Certainly he has. It follows that he doesn't want to. There's reasoning for you. And why doesn't he want to? Gentlemen, the reason is this.
VLADIMIR: Make a note of this.
POZZO: He wants to impress me, so that I'll keep him.
ESTRAGON: What?
POZZO: Perhaps I haven't got it quite right. He wants to mollify me, so that I'll give up the idea of parting with him. No, that's not exactly it either.
VLADIMIR: You want to get rid of him?
POZZO: He wants to cod me, but he won't.
VLADIMIR: You want to get rid of him?
POZZO: He imagines that when I see how well he carries I'll be tempted to keep him on in that capacity.
ESTRAGON: You've had enough of him?
POZZO: In reality he carries like a pig. It's not his job.
VLADIMIR: You want to get rid of him?
POZZO: He imagines that when I see him indefatigable I'll regret my decision. Such is his miserable scheme. As though I were short of slaves! Atlas, son of Jupiter! Well, that's that, I think. Anything else?
VLADIMIR: You want to get rid of him?
POZZO: Remark that I might just as well have been in his shoes and he in mine. If chance had not willed otherwise. To each one his due.
VLADIMIR: You waagerrim?
POZZO: I beg your pardon?
VLADIMIR: You want to get rid of him?
POZZO: I do. But instead of driving him away as I might have done, I mean instead of simply kicking him out on his arse, in the goodness of my heart I am bringing him to the fair, where I hope to get a good price for him. The truth is you can't drive such creatures away. The best thing would be to kill them.
ESTRAGON: He's crying!
POZZO: Old dogs have more dignity. Comfort him, since you pity him. Come on. Wipe away his tears, he'll feel less forsaken.
VLADIMIR: Here, give it to me, I'll do it.
POZZO: Make haste, before he stops. Hanky!
ESTRAGON: Oh the swine! He's crippled me!
POZZO: I told you he didn't like strangers.
VLADIMIR: Show me. He's bleeding!
POZZO: It's a good sign.
ESTRAGON: I'll never walk again!
VLADIMIR: I'll carry you. If necessary.
POZZO: He's stopped crying. You have replaced him as it were. The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep, somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh. Let us not then speak ill of our generation, it is not any unhappier than its predecessors. Let us not speak well of it either. Let us not speak of it at all. It is true the population has increased.
VLADIMIR: Try and walk.
POZZO: Guess who taught me all these beautiful things. My Lucky!
VLADIMIR: Will night never come?
POZZO: But for him all my thoughts, all my feelings, would have been of common things. Professional worries! Beauty, grace, truth of the first water, I knew they were all beyond me. So I took a knook.
VLADIMIR: A knook?
POZZO: That was nearly sixty years ago … yes, nearly sixty. You wouldn't think it to look at me, would you? Compared to him I look like a young man, no? Hat! Now look. Did you see?
VLADIMIR: And now you turn him away? Such an old and faithful servant!
ESTRAGON: Swine!
VLADIMIR: After having sucked all the good out of him you chuck him away like a … like a banana skin. Really …
POZZO: I can't bear it … any longer … the way he goes on … you've no idea … it's terrible … he must go … I'm going mad … I can't bear it … any longer …
VLADIMIR: He can't bear it.
ESTRAGON: Any longer.
VLADIMIR: He's going mad.
ESTRAGON: It's terrible.
VLADIMIR: How dare you! It's abominable! Such a good master! Crucify him like that! After so many years! Really!
POZZO: He used to be so kind … so helpful … and entertaining … my good angel … and now … he's killing me.
ESTRAGON: Does he want to replace him?
VLADIMIR: What?
ESTRAGON: Does he want someone to take his place or not?
VLADIMIR: I don't think so.
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: I don't know.
ESTRAGON: Ask him.
POZZO: Gentlemen, I don't know what came over me. Forgive me. Forget all I said. I don't remember exactly what it was, but you may be sure there wasn't a word of truth in it. Do I look like a man that can be made to suffer? Frankly? What have I done with my pipe?
VLADIMIR: Charming evening we're having.
ESTRAGON: Unforgettable.
VLADIMIR: And it's not over.
ESTRAGON: Apparently not.
VLADIMIR: It's only beginning.
ESTRAGON: It's awful.
VLADIMIR: Worse than the pantomime.
ESTRAGON: The circus.
VLADIMIR: The music-hall.
ESTRAGON: The circus.
POZZO: What can I have done with that briar?
ESTRAGON: He's a scream. He's lost his dudeen.
VLADIMIR: I'll be back.
ESTRAGON: End of the corridor, on the left.
VLADIMIR: Keep my seat.
POZZO: I've lost my Kapp and Peterson!
ESTRAGON: He'll be the death of me!
POZZO: You didn't see by any chance– Oh! He's gone! Without saying goodbye! How could he! He might have waited!
ESTRAGON: He would have burst.
POZZO: Oh! Oh well then of course in that case …
ESTRAGON: Come here.
POZZO: What for?
ESTRAGON: You'll see.
POZZO: You want me to get up?
ESTRAGON: Quick! Look!
POZZO: Oh I say!
ESTRAGON: It's all over.
POZZO: He's not pleased.
ESTRAGON: You missed a treat. Pity.
POZZO: He subsides. Indeed all subsides. A great calm descends. Listen! Pan sleeps.
VLADIMIR: Will night never come?
POZZO: You don't feel like going until it does?
ESTRAGON: Well you see—
POZZO: Why it's very natural, very natural. I myself in your situation, if I had an appointment with a Godin … Godet … Godot … anyhow, you see who I mean, I'd wait till it was black night before I gave up. I'd very much like to sit down, but I don't quite know how to go about it.
ESTRAGON: Could I be of any help?
POZZO: If you asked me perhaps.
ESTRAGON: What?
POZZO: If you asked me to sit down.
ESTRAGON: Would that be a help?
POZZO: I fancy so.
ESTRAGON: Here we go. Be seated, Sir, I beg of you.
POZZO: No no, I wouldn't think of it! Ask me again.
ESTRAGON: Come come, take a seat I beseech you, you'll get pneumonia.
POZZO: You really think so?
ESTRAGON: Why it's absolutely certain.
POZZO: No doubt you are right. Done it again! Thank you, dear fellow. But I must really be getting along, if I am to observe my schedule.
VLADIMIR: Time has stopped.
POZZO: Don't you believe it, Sir, don't you believe it. Whatever you like, but not that.
ESTRAGON: Everything seems black to him today.
POZZO: Except the firmament. But I see what it is, you are not from these parts, you don't know what our twilights can do. Shall I tell you? I can't refuse you. A little attention, if you please. What's the matter with this whip? Worn out, this whip. What was I saying?
VLADIMIR: Let's go.
ESTRAGON: But take the weight off your feet, I implore you, you'll catch your death.
POZZO: True. What is your name?
ESTRAGON: Adam.
POZZO: Ah yes! The night. But be a little more attentive, for pity's sake, otherwise we'll never get anywhere. Look! Will you look at the sky, pig! Good, that's enough. What is there so extraordinary about it? Qua sky. It is pale and luminous like any sky at this hour of the day. In these latitudes. When the weather is fine. An hour ago roughly after having poured forth even since say ten o'clock in the morning tirelessly torrents of red and white light it begins to lose its effulgence, to grow pale pale, ever a little paler, a little paler until pppfff! finished! it comes to rest. But– – but behind this veil of gentleness and peace, night is charging and will burst upon us pop! like that! just when we least expect it. That's how it is on this bitch of an earth.
ESTRAGON: So long as one knows.
VLADIMIR: One can bide one's time.
ESTRAGON: One knows what to expect.
VLADIMIR: No further need to worry.
ESTRAGON: Simply wait.
VLADIMIR: We're used to it.
POZZO: How did you find me? Good? Fair? Middling? Poor? Positively bad?
VLADIMIR: Oh very good, very very good.
POZZO: And you, Sir?
ESTRAGON: Oh tray bong, tray tray tray bong.
POZZO: Bless you, gentlemen, bless you! I have such need of encouragement! I weakened a little towards the end, you didn't notice?
VLADIMIR: Oh perhaps just a teeny weeny little bit.
ESTRAGON: I thought it was intentional.
POZZO: You see my memory is defective.
ESTRAGON: In the meantime, nothing happens.
POZZO: You find it tedious?
ESTRAGON: Somewhat.
POZZO: And you, Sir?
VLADIMIR: I've been better entertained.
POZZO: Gentlemen, you have been … civil to me.
ESTRAGON: Not at all!
VLADIMIR: What an idea!
POZZO: Yes yes, you have been correct. So that I ask myself is there anything I can do in my turn for these honest fellows who are having such a dull, dull time.
ESTRAGON: Even ten francs would be a help.
VLADIMIR: We are not beggars!
POZZO: Is there anything I can do, that's what I ask myself, to cheer them up? I have given them bones, I have talked to them about this and that, I have explained the twilight, admittedly. But is it enough, that's what tortures me, is it enough?
ESTRAGON: Even five.
VLADIMIR: That's enough!
ESTRAGON: I couldn't accept less.
POZZO: Is is enough? No doubt. But I am liberal. It's my nature. This evening. So much the worse for me. For I shall suffer, no doubt about that. What do you prefer? Shall we have him dance, or sing, or recite, or think, or—
ESTRAGON: Who?
POZZO: Who! You know how to think, you two?
VLADIMIR: He thinks?
POZZO: Certainly. Aloud. He even used to think very prettily once, I could listen to him for hours. Now … So much the worse for me. Well, would you like him to think something for us?
ESTRAGON: I'd rather he dance, it'd be more fun.
POZZO: Not necessarily.
ESTRAGON: Wouldn't it, Didi, be more fun?
VLADIMIR: I'd like well to hear him think.
ESTRAGON: Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, if it isn't too much to ask him.
VLADIMIR: Would that be possible?
POZZO: By all means, nothing simpler. It's the natural order.
VLADIMIR: Then let him dance.
POZZO: Do you hear, hog?
ESTRAGON: He never refuses?
POZZO: He refused once. Dance, misery!
ESTRAGON: Is that all?
POZZO: Encore!
ESTRAGON: Pooh! I'd do as well myself. With a little practice.
POZZO: He used to dance the farandole, the fling, the brawl, the jig, the fandango and even the hornpipe. He capered. For joy. Now that's the best he can do. Do you know what he calls it?
ESTRAGON: The Scapegoat's Agony.
VLADIMIR: The Hard Stool.
POZZO: The Net. He thinks he's entangled in a net.
VLADIMIR: There's something about it …
POZZO: Woaa!
ESTRAGON: Tell us about the time he refused.
POZZO: With pleasure, with pleasure. Wait. What have I done with my spray? Well now isn't that … I can't find my pulverizer!
ESTRAGON: My left lung is very weak! But my right lung is as sound as a bell!
POZZO: No matter! What was I saying. Wait. Well now isn't that … Help me!
ESTRAGON: Wait!
VLADIMIR: Wait!
POZZO: Wait!
ESTRAGON: Ah!
VLADIMIR: He has it.
POZZO: Well?
ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags?
VLADIMIR: Rubbish!
POZZO: Are you sure?
VLADIMIR: Damn it haven't you already told us?
POZZO: I've already told you?
ESTRAGON: He's already told us?
VLADIMIR: Anyway he has put them down.
ESTRAGON: So he has. And what of it?
VLADIMIR: Since he has put down his bags it is impossible we should have asked why he does not do so.
POZZO: Stoutly reasoned!
ESTRAGON: And why has he put them down?
POZZO: Answer us that.
VLADIMIR: In order to dance.
ESTRAGON: True!
POZZO: True!
ESTRAGON: Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!
VLADIMIR: Tell him to think.
POZZO: Give him his hat.
VLADIMIR: His hat?
POZZO: He can't think without his hat.
VLADIMIR: Give him his hat.
ESTRAGON: Me! After what he did to me! Never!
VLADIMIR: I'll give it to him.
ESTRAGON: Tell him to go and fetch it.
POZZO: It's better to give it to him.
VLADIMIR: I'll give it to him.
POZZO: You must put it on his head.
ESTRAGON: Tell him to take it.
POZZO: It's better to put it on his head.
VLADIMIR: I'll put it on his head.
ESTRAGON: What's he waiting for?
POZZO: Stand back! Think, pig! Stop! Forward! Stop! Think!
LUCKY: On the other hand with regard to—
POZZO: Stop! Back! Stop! Turn! Think!
LUCKY: … tennis … the stones … so calm … Cunard … unfinished …
POZZO: His hat!
ESTRAGON: Avenged!
POZZO: Give me that! There's an end to his thinking!
VLADIMIR: But will he be able to walk?
POZZO: Walk or crawl! Up pig!
ESTRAGON: Perhaps he's dead.
VLADIMIR: You'll kill him.
POZZO: Up scum! Help me!
VLADIMIR: How?
POZZO: Raise him up!
ESTRAGON: He's doing it on purpose!
POZZO: You must hold him. Come on, come on, raise him up.
ESTRAGON: To hell with him!
VLADIMIR: Come on, once more.
ESTRAGON: What does he take us for?
POZZO: Don't let him go! Don't move! Hold him tight! Don't let him go! Hold him tight! Now! You can let him go. Forward! Back! Turn! Done it! He can walk. Thank you, gentlemen, and let me … let me wish you … wish you … what have I done with my watch? A genuine half-hunter, gentlemen, with deadbeat escapement! Twas my granpa gave it to me! Well now isn't that just—
VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's in your fob.
POZZO: Wait! I hear nothing. Surely one should hear the tick-tick.
VLADIMIR: Silence!
ESTRAGON: I hear something.
POZZO: Where?
VLADIMIR: It's the heart.
POZZO: Damnation!
VLADIMIR: Silence!
ESTRAGON: Perhaps it has stopped.
POZZO: Which of you smells so bad?
ESTRAGON: He has stinking breath and I have stinking feet.
POZZO: I must go.
ESTRAGON: And your half-hunter?
POZZO: I must have left it at the manor.
ESTRAGON: Then adieu.
POZZO: Adieu.
VLADIMIR: Adieu.
POZZO: Adieu.
VLADIMIR: Adieu.
POZZO: Adieu.
ESTRAGON: Adieu.
POZZO: And thank you.
VLADIMIR: Thank .
POZZO: Not at all.
ESTRAGON: Yes yes.
POZZO: No no.
VLADIMIR: Yes yes.
ESTRAGON: No no.
POZZO: I don't seem to be able … to depart.
ESTRAGON: Such is life.
VLADIMIR: You're going the wrong way.
POZZO: I need a running start. Stand back! On! On!
ESTRAGON: On!
VLADIMIR: On!
POZZO: Faster! On! On! Stool! Adieu!
VLADIMIR and ESTRAGON: Adieu! Adieu!
POZZO: Up! Pig! On! Faster! On! Adieu! Pig! Yip! Adieu!
VLADIMIR: That passed the time.
ESTRAGON: It would have passed in any case.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but not so rapidly.
ESTRAGON: What do we do now?
VLADIMIR: I don't know.
ESTRAGON: Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah!
VLADIMIR: How they've changed!
ESTRAGON: Who?
VLADIMIR: Those two.
ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's make a little conversation.
VLADIMIR: Haven't they?
ESTRAGON: What?
VLADIMIR: Changed.
ESTRAGON: Very likely. They all change. Only we can't.
VLADIMIR: Likely! It's certain. Didn't you see them?
ESTRAGON: I suppose I did. But I don't know them.
VLADIMIR: Yes you do know them.
ESTRAGON: No I don't know them.
VLADIMIR: We know them, I tell you. You forget everything. Unless they're not the same …
ESTRAGON: Why didn't they recognize us then?
VLADIMIR: That means nothing. I too pretended not to recognize them. And then nobody ever recognizes us.
ESTRAGON: Forget it. What we need– Ow! Ow!
VLADIMIR: Unless they're not the same …
ESTRAGON: Didi! It's the other foot!
VLADIMIR: Unless they're not the same …
BOY: Mister!
ESTRAGON: Off we go again.
VLADIMIR: Approach, my child.
BOY: Mister Albert … ?
VLADIMIR: Yes.
ESTRAGON: What do you want?
VLADIMIR: Approach!
ESTRAGON: Approach when you're told, can't you?
VLADIMIR: What is it?
BOY: Mr. Godot …
VLADIMIR: Obviously … Approach.
ESTRAGON: Will you approach! What kept you so late?
VLADIMIR: You have a message from Mr. Godot?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Well, what is it?
ESTRAGON: What kept you so late?
VLADIMIR: Let him alone.
ESTRAGON: You let me alone. Do you know what time it is?
BOY: It's not my fault, Sir.
ESTRAGON: And whose is it? Mine?
BOY: I was afraid, Sir.
ESTRAGON: Afraid of what? Of us? Answer me!
VLADIMIR: I know what it is, he was afraid of the others.
ESTRAGON: How long have you been here?
BOY: A good while, Sir.
VLADIMIR: You were afraid of the whip?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: The roars?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: The two big men.
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Do you know them?
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: Are you a native of these parts? Do you belong to these parts?
BOY: Yes Sir.
ESTRAGON: That's all a pack of lies. Tell us the truth!
BOY: But it is the truth, Sir!
VLADIMIR: Will you let him alone! What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you?
ESTRAGON: I'm unhappy.
VLADIMIR: Not really! Since when?
ESTRAGON: I'd forgotten.
VLADIMIR: Extraordinary the tricks that memory plays! Well?
BOY: Mr. Godot—
VLADIMIR: I've seen you before, haven't I?
BOY: I don't know, Sir.
VLADIMIR: You don't know me?
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: It wasn't you came yesterday?
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: This is your first time?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Words words. Speak.
BOY: Mr. Godot told me to tell you he won't come this evening but surely tomorrow.
VLADIMIR: Is that all?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: You work for Mr. Godot?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: What do you do?
BOY: I mind the goats, Sir.
VLADIMIR: Is he good to you?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: He doesn't beat you?
BOY: No Sir, not me.
VLADIMIR: Whom does he beat?
BOY: He beats my brother, Sir.
VLADIMIR: Ah, you have a brother?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: What does he do?
BOY: He minds the sheep, Sir.
VLADIMIR: And why doesn't he beat you?
BOY: I don't know, Sir.
VLADIMIR: He must be fond of you.
BOY: I don't know, Sir.
VLADIMIR: Does he give you enough to eat? Does he feed you well?
BOY: Fairly well, Sir.
VLADIMIR: You're not unhappy? Do you hear me?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: Well?
BOY: I don't know, Sir.
VLADIMIR: You don't know if you're unhappy or not?
BOY: No Sir.
VLADIMIR: You're as bad as myself. Where do you sleep?
BOY: In the loft, Sir.
VLADIMIR: With your brother?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: In the hay?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: All right, you may go.
BOY: What am I to tell Mr. Godot, Sir?
VLADIMIR: Tell him … tell him you saw us. You did see us, didn't you?
BOY: Yes Sir.
VLADIMIR: At last! What are you doing?
ESTRAGON: Pale for weariness.
VLADIMIR: Eh?
ESTRAGON: Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us.
VLADIMIR: Your boots, what are you doing with your boots?
ESTRAGON: I'm leaving them there. Another will come, just as … as … as me, but with smaller feet, and they'll make him happy.
VLADIMIR: But you can't go barefoot!
ESTRAGON: Christ did.
VLADIMIR: Christ! What has Christ got to do with it. You're not going to compare yourself to Christ!
ESTRAGON: All my life I've compared myself to him.
VLADIMIR: But where he lived it was warm, it was dry!
ESTRAGON: Yes. And they crucified quick.
VLADIMIR: We've nothing more to do here.
ESTRAGON: Nor anywhere else.
VLADIMIR: Ah Gogo, don't go on like that. Tomorrow everything will be better.
ESTRAGON: How do you make that out?
VLADIMIR: Did you not hear what the child said?
ESTRAGON: No.
VLADIMIR: He said that Godot was sure to come tomorrow. What do you say to that?
ESTRAGON: Then all we have to do is to wait on here.
VLADIMIR: Are you mad? We must take cover. Come on.
ESTRAGON: Pity we haven't got a bit of rope.
VLADIMIR: Come on. It's cold.
ESTRAGON: Remind me to bring a bit of rope tomorrow.
VLADIMIR: Yes. Come on.
ESTRAGON: How long have we been together all the time now?
VLADIMIR: I don't know. Fifty years maybe.
ESTRAGON: Do you remember the day I threw myself into the Rhone?
VLADIMIR: We were grape harvesting.
ESTRAGON: You fished me out.
VLADIMIR: That's all dead and buried.
ESTRAGON: My clothes dried in the sun.
VLADIMIR: There's no good harking back on that. Come on.
ESTRAGON: Wait!
VLADIMIR: I'm cold!
ESTRAGON: Wait! I sometimes wonder if we wouldn't have been better off alone, each one for himself. We weren't made for the same road.
VLADIMIR: It's not certain.
ESTRAGON: No, nothing is certain.
VLADIMIR: We can still part, if you think it would be better.
ESTRAGON: It's not worthwhile now.
VLADIMIR: No, it's not worthwhile now.
ESTRAGON: Well, shall we go?
VLADIMIR: Yes, let's go.
