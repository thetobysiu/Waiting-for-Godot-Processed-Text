VLADIMIR: Well? What do we do?
ESTRAGON: Don't let's do anything. It's safer.
VLADIMIR: Let's wait and see what he says.
ESTRAGON: Who?
VLADIMIR: Godot.
ESTRAGON: Good idea.
VLADIMIR: Let's wait till we know exactly how we stand.
ESTRAGON: On the other hand it might be better to strike the iron before it freezes.
VLADIMIR: I'm curious to hear what he has to offer. Then we'll take it or leave it.
ESTRAGON: What exactly did we ask him for?
VLADIMIR: Were you not there?
ESTRAGON: I can't have been listening.
VLADIMIR: Oh … Nothing very definite.
ESTRAGON: A kind of prayer.
VLADIMIR: Precisely.
ESTRAGON: A vague supplication.
VLADIMIR: Exactly.
ESTRAGON: And what did he reply?
VLADIMIR: That he'd see.
ESTRAGON: That he couldn't promise anything.
VLADIMIR: That he'd have to think it over.
ESTRAGON: In the quiet of his home.
VLADIMIR: Consult his family.
ESTRAGON: His friends.
VLADIMIR: His agents.
ESTRAGON: His correspondents.
VLADIMIR: His books.
ESTRAGON: His bank account.
VLADIMIR: Before taking a decision.
ESTRAGON: It's the normal thing.
VLADIMIR: Is it not?
ESTRAGON: I think it is.
VLADIMIR: I think so too.
ESTRAGON: And we?
VLADIMIR: I beg your pardon?
ESTRAGON: I said, And we?
VLADIMIR: I don't understand.
ESTRAGON: Where do we come in?
VLADIMIR: Come in?
ESTRAGON: Take your time.
VLADIMIR: Come in? On our hands and knees.
ESTRAGON: As bad as that?
VLADIMIR: Your Worship wishes to assert his prerogatives?
ESTRAGON: We've no rights any more?
VLADIMIR: You'd make me laugh if it wasn't prohibited.
ESTRAGON: We've lost our rights?
VLADIMIR: We got rid of them.
ESTRAGON: We're not tied? We're not—
VLADIMIR: Listen!
ESTRAGON: I hear nothing.
VLADIMIR: Hsst! Nor I.
ESTRAGON: You gave me a fright.
VLADIMIR: I thought it was he.
ESTRAGON: Who?
VLADIMIR: Godot.
ESTRAGON: Pah! The wind in the reeds.
VLADIMIR: I could have sworn I heard shouts.
ESTRAGON: And why would he shout?
VLADIMIR: At his horse.
ESTRAGON: I'm hungry!
VLADIMIR: Do you want a carrot?
ESTRAGON: Is that all there is?
VLADIMIR: I might have some turnips.
ESTRAGON: Give me a carrot. It's a turnip!
VLADIMIR: Oh pardon! I could have sworn it was a carrot. All that's turnips. You must have eaten the last. Wait, I have it. There, dear fellow. Make it last, that's the end of them.
ESTRAGON: I asked you a question.
VLADIMIR: Ah.
ESTRAGON: Did you reply?
VLADIMIR: How's the carrot?
ESTRAGON: It's a carrot.
VLADIMIR: So much the better, so much the better. What was it you wanted to know?
ESTRAGON: I've forgotten. That's what annoys me. I'll never forget this carrot. Ah yes, now I remember.
VLADIMIR: Well?
ESTRAGON: We're not tied?
VLADIMIR: I don't hear a word you're saying.
ESTRAGON: I'm asking you if we're tied.
VLADIMIR: Tied?
ESTRAGON: Ti-ed.
VLADIMIR: How do you mean tied?
ESTRAGON: Down.
VLADIMIR: But to whom? By whom?
ESTRAGON: To your man.
VLADIMIR: To Godot? Tied to Godot! What an idea! No question of it. For the moment.
ESTRAGON: His name is Godot?
VLADIMIR: I think so.
ESTRAGON: Fancy that. Funny, the more you eat the worse it gets.
VLADIMIR: With me it's just the opposite.
ESTRAGON: In other words?
VLADIMIR: I get used to the muck as I go along.
ESTRAGON: Is that the opposite?
VLADIMIR: Question of temperament.
ESTRAGON: Of character.
VLADIMIR: Nothing you can do about it.
ESTRAGON: No use struggling.
VLADIMIR: One is what one is.
ESTRAGON: No use wriggling.
VLADIMIR: The essential doesn't change.
ESTRAGON: Nothing to be done. Like to finish it?
VLADIMIR: Where are your boots?
ESTRAGON: I must have thrown them away.
VLADIMIR: When?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: Why?
ESTRAGON: I don't know why I don't know!
VLADIMIR: No, I mean why did you throw them away?
ESTRAGON: Because they were hurting me!
VLADIMIR: There they are! At the very spot where you left them yesterday!
ESTRAGON: They're not mine.
VLADIMIR: Not yours!
ESTRAGON: Mine were black. These are brown.
VLADIMIR: You're sure yours were black?
ESTRAGON: Well they were a kind of gray.
VLADIMIR: And these are brown. Show me.
ESTRAGON: Well they're a kind of green.
VLADIMIR: Show me. Well of all the—
ESTRAGON: You see, all that's a lot of bloody—
VLADIMIR: Ah! I see what it is. Yes, I see what's happened.
ESTRAGON: All that's a lot of bloody—
VLADIMIR: It's elementary. Someone came and took yours and left you his.
ESTRAGON: Why?
VLADIMIR: His were too tight for him, so he took yours.
ESTRAGON: But mine were too tight.
VLADIMIR: For you. Not for him.
ESTRAGON: I'm tired! Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! What'll we do, what'll we do!
VLADIMIR: There's nothing we can do.
ESTRAGON: But I can't go on like this!
VLADIMIR: Would you like a radish?
ESTRAGON: Is that all there is?
VLADIMIR: There are radishes and turnips.
ESTRAGON: Are there no carrots?
VLADIMIR: No. Anyway you overdo it with your carrots.
ESTRAGON: Then give me a radish. It's black!
VLADIMIR: It's a radish.
ESTRAGON: I only like the pink ones, you know that!
VLADIMIR: Then you don't want it?
ESTRAGON: I only like the pink ones!
VLADIMIR: Then give it back to me.
ESTRAGON: I'll go and get a carrot.
VLADIMIR: This is becoming really insignificant.
ESTRAGON: Not enough.
VLADIMIR: What about trying them.
ESTRAGON: I've tried everything.
VLADIMIR: No, I mean the boots.
ESTRAGON: Would that be a good thing?
VLADIMIR: It'd pass the time. I assure you, it'd be an occupation.
ESTRAGON: A relaxation.
VLADIMIR: A recreation.
ESTRAGON: A relaxation.
VLADIMIR: Try.
ESTRAGON: You'll help me?
VLADIMIR: I will of course.
ESTRAGON: We don't manage too badly, eh Didi, between the two of us?
VLADIMIR: Yes yes. Come on, we'll try the left first.
ESTRAGON: We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist?
VLADIMIR: Yes yes, we're magicians. But let us persevere in what we have resolved, before we forget. Come on, give me your foot. The other, hog! Higher! Try and walk. Well?
ESTRAGON: It fits.
VLADIMIR: We'll try and lace it.
ESTRAGON: No no, no laces, no laces!
VLADIMIR: You'll be sorry. Let's try the other. Well?
ESTRAGON: It fits too.
VLADIMIR: They don't hurt you?
ESTRAGON: Not yet.
VLADIMIR: Then you can keep them.
ESTRAGON: They're too big.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps you'll have socks some day.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Then you'll keep them?
ESTRAGON: That's enough about these boots.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but—
ESTRAGON: Enough! I suppose I might as well sit down.
