VLADIMIR: Where are your boots?
ESTRAGON: I must have thrown them away.
VLADIMIR: When?
ESTRAGON: I don't know.
VLADIMIR: Why?
ESTRAGON: I don't know why I don't know!
VLADIMIR: No, I mean why did you throw them away?
ESTRAGON: Because they were hurting me!
VLADIMIR: There they are! At the very spot where you left them yesterday!
ESTRAGON: They're not mine.
VLADIMIR: Not yours!
ESTRAGON: Mine were black. These are brown.
VLADIMIR: You're sure yours were black?
ESTRAGON: Well they were a kind of gray.
VLADIMIR: And these are brown. Show me.
ESTRAGON: Well they're a kind of green.
VLADIMIR: Show me. Well of all the—
ESTRAGON: You see, all that's a lot of bloody—
VLADIMIR: Ah! I see what it is. Yes, I see what's happened.
ESTRAGON: All that's a lot of bloody—
VLADIMIR: It's elementary. Someone came and took yours and left you his.
ESTRAGON: Why?
VLADIMIR: His were too tight for him, so he took yours.
ESTRAGON: But mine were too tight.
VLADIMIR: For you. Not for him.
ESTRAGON: I'm tired! Let's go.
VLADIMIR: We can't.
ESTRAGON: Why not?
VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! What'll we do, what'll we do!
VLADIMIR: There's nothing we can do.
ESTRAGON: But I can't go on like this!
VLADIMIR: Would you like a radish?
ESTRAGON: Is that all there is?
VLADIMIR: There are radishes and turnips.
ESTRAGON: Are there no carrots?
VLADIMIR: No. Anyway you overdo it with your carrots.
ESTRAGON: Then give me a radish. It's black!
VLADIMIR: It's a radish.
ESTRAGON: I only like the pink ones, you know that!
VLADIMIR: Then you don't want it?
ESTRAGON: I only like the pink ones!
VLADIMIR: Then give it back to me.
ESTRAGON: I'll go and get a carrot.
VLADIMIR: This is becoming really insignificant.
ESTRAGON: Not enough.
VLADIMIR: What about trying them.
ESTRAGON: I've tried everything.
VLADIMIR: No, I mean the boots.
ESTRAGON: Would that be a good thing?
VLADIMIR: It'd pass the time. I assure you, it'd be an occupation.
ESTRAGON: A relaxation.
VLADIMIR: A recreation.
ESTRAGON: A relaxation.
VLADIMIR: Try.
ESTRAGON: You'll help me?
VLADIMIR: I will of course.
ESTRAGON: We don't manage too badly, eh Didi, between the two of us?
VLADIMIR: Yes yes. Come on, we'll try the left first.
ESTRAGON: We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist?
VLADIMIR: Yes yes, we're magicians. But let us persevere in what we have resolved, before we forget. Come on, give me your foot. The other, hog! Higher! Try and walk. Well?
ESTRAGON: It fits.
VLADIMIR: We'll try and lace it.
ESTRAGON: No no, no laces, no laces!
VLADIMIR: You'll be sorry. Let's try the other. Well?
ESTRAGON: It fits too.
VLADIMIR: They don't hurt you?
ESTRAGON: Not yet.
VLADIMIR: Then you can keep them.
ESTRAGON: They're too big.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps you'll have socks some day.
ESTRAGON: True.
VLADIMIR: Then you'll keep them?
ESTRAGON: That's enough about these boots.
VLADIMIR: Yes, but—
ESTRAGON: Enough! I suppose I might as well sit down.
